                    <h3><b>JUST AN ORDINARY GIRL WITH AN EXTRORDINARY DREAM!!!</b> </h3>
                    I am born and raised in a conservative South Indian town. Even as I grew up, my grandmother’s and mother’s life experiences have had a profound impact in shaping my individual aspirations. ‘For a woman, a good education is the only way to earn her independence and retain her individuality’, they would say and inspire me everyday.It was at that moment,I realized and aspired for a career that would not only impact my life but also others in a positive way.Being an active coder since my undergrad, I always wanted to build applications that impact and optimize processes for the benefit of mankind.To be more specific, in the long term I envision to build a system that would offer a mentor-mentee program to prevent school drop-outs of under-privileged children.I will harness the technology and my experiences to scale the program to a global level.</div>

                    <h3><b>A PASSIONATE FULL STACK DEVELOPER DRIVEN TO SOLVE PROBLEMS thru state-of-art tech!!!</b> </h3>
I'm a Graduate student pursuing my Masters in Computer Sciences at Columbia University,New York City.My interests are at the intersection of building Full-stack Applications and applying Machine Learning Models in Cloud Environments. 
Also as a research assistant to Professor Eugene Wu,I study and research machine learning algorithms with respect to Reinforcement Learning domain to optimize the frameworks built to capture and retrieve data visualization and data exploration applications.
Over all, it’s a great field to get your hands dirty in, given that you love the subject to its core!!! After all, persistence and passion is all that matters.

I previously worked as a Software Engineer with a demonstrated history of building full stack- Software applications in Financial Services Industry(JP Morgan Chase).At Chase, I worked on building UI applications to monitor the real time transactions, strategically breaking down legacy systems to microservices and adopting cloud.This wholesome experience ( from UI to backend) at my previous company enables me to build highly scalable and performant systems.
